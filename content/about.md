## About me

Hi there!

My name is Yoshiharu Yamashita, Yoshi for short.

I am originally from Japan but in 2001 I made one of the biggest decisions in my life and came to England to do a university degree course.

Being so far from home was not easy to begin with but life in England has turned out to be better than I could ever have imagined when I made that decision.

I am currently living and working in Bristol, UK.

### Software Engineer

That's my main job. I currently work on software tools to automatically check and correct video/audio problems in file-based media. In my role, I mainly code in C++ but I often get to use C#, JavaScript and Python as well, which I like.

### Freelance Translator

I also carry out English to Japanese translations and proofreading for computer related areas, including

- GUIs
- Technical user guides, website contents
- Voice over for video tutorials

It's good to combine my language skills with computing.

### Wannabe Freestyle Footballer

I keep a football in my office and practice at lunch time. My current favourite place to practice is the alley at the back of my office off which there are several pubs. The surface is uneven and made of cobbles but I like it there because it's very quiet at lunch time.
